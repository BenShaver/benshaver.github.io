I'm a [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/). Starting in July 2025, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University's [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). 

My primary research interests are in the fields of political economy and applied game theory.
