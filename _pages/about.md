I'm a rising fifth-year [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/), and I will be on the Political Science job market in the fall of 2024. My primary research interests are formal theory, American politics, and information economics. I am currently working on research on policy reform, the effect of fact-checking on cheap-talk communication, career concerns and succession in political organizations, and dynamic policy experimentation. My job market paper, ``Signaling Ability through Policy Change," analyzes a formal model of policy change when there is uncertainty about a policymaker's ability to develop high-quality policy.  

Before my Ph.D., I completed a research fellowship at the University of Chicago's [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), a Master's degree at the University of Chicago's [Committee on International Relations](https://cir.uchicago.edu/), and a Bachelor's in International Studies with a minor in Statistics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).
