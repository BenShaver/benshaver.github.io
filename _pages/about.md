I'm a [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/), and I am on the political science and public policy job market. My primary research interests are formal theory, American politics, and political economy. I am currently working on research on policy reform, the effect of fact-checking on cheap-talk communication, career concerns and succession in political organizations, and dynamic policy experimentation. My job market paper, "[Signaling Ability Through Policy Change](http://benshaver.github.io/files/Ability BS.pdf)," examines how uncertainty about a policymaker's ability to develop high-quality policies affects her policymaking decisions. 

Before my Ph.D., I completed a research fellowship at the University of Chicago's [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), a Master's degree at the University of Chicago's [Committee on International Relations](https://cir.uchicago.edu/), and a Bachelor's in International Studies with a minor in Statistics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).
