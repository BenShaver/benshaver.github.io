I'm a fourth-year [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/). My broad interests are in applied game theory, American politics, and information economics. Recently, I have worked on research on the effect of fact-checking on cheap talk, career concerns among elits in political parties, and dynamic policy experimentation. 

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed a research fellowship at the University of Chicago's [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), a Master's degree at the University of Chicago's [Committee on International Relations](https://cir.uchicago.edu/), and a Bachelor's in International Studies with minor in Statistics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).
