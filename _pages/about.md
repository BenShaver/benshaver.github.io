I'm a fourth-year Political Economy Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and Department of Political Science. My broad interests are in applied game theory, American politics, and information economics. Recently, I have worked on research on the effect of fact-checking on cheap talk communication, career concerns in political parties, and dynamic policy experimentation.
