I am a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University's [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). Before beginning at Kellogg, I earned my Ph.D. in [political economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) from the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/). 

In my research, I use applied game theory to study topics at the intersection of political economy and organizational economics. I am currently interested in how electoral incentives influence when politicians act during their terms and how rank-order competition affects delegation within teams. 

My work has been published in or is forthcoming in the *Journal of Politics*, the *Economic Journal*, and *Science Advances*.
