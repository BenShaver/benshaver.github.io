I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University's [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). Before beginning at Kellogg, I earned my Ph.D. in Political Economy from the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/).
